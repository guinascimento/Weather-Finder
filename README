== Overview

Weather Finder is a Ruby library to access Weather.com data (XOAP). The library uses Hpricot and MemCached and allows fetch current forecast data from anywhere location.

In order to use this library, you need to get a partner_id and license_key from Weather.com service at:
http://www.weather.com/services/xmloap.html

After signed up, you will receive an email with partner_id and license_key.

If you need read the complete terms and conditions about the use of the service, you can download the SDK from link below:
http://download.weather.com/web/xml/sdk.zip

In this .zip file, you can find too the graphical icons to represent the conditions associated with the current forecast.

== Quick Install

RubyGem:

	sudo gem install weatherfinder

== Fetching current conditions

	require "weatherfinder"

	service = Weather::WeatherFinder.new

	# Partner ID and License Key provided by Weather.com
	service.partner_id = your partner id
	service.license_key = your license key

	# Fetching current forecast from Rio de Janeiro ;)
	forecast = service.load_forecast("BRXX0201")

	puts "Current Description: " + forecast.current.description
	puts "Current Temperature: " + forecast.current.temp
	puts "Current Icon: " + forecast.current.icon
	puts "Current Wind Speed: " + forecast.current.wind.speed

== Fetching tomorrow's forecast:

	puts "Tomorrow's High Temperature: " + forecast.tomorrow.high
	puts "Tomorrow's Low Temperature: " + forecast.tomorrow.low
	puts "Tomorrow's Sunrise: " + forecast.tomorrow.sunrise
	puts "Tomorrow's Sunset: " + forecast.tomorrow.sunset
	puts "Tomorrow's Wind Speed" + forecast.tomorrow.wind.speed

== Future Forecasts

Future forecasts can be accessed using day() method from Forecast class. This method accept an argument indicating the number of days that will be fetched. This functionality depends of the day that was defined at load_forecast() method.

	puts "High Temperature 2 days from now: " + forecast.day(2).high
	puts "High Temperature 2 days from now: " + forecast.day(2).low
	puts "Sunrise 2 days from now: " + forecast.day(2).sunrise
	puts "Sunset 2 days from now: " + forecast.day(2).sunset

== Cache

WeatherFinder uses Memcached[http://www.danga.com/memcached/] to support data caching. This functionality is very useful when a lot of requests are made by clients.

You need to install Ruby-MemCache[http://www.deveiate.org/code/Ruby-MemCache/] Gem:

	sudo gem install Ruby-MemCache

After installation, you need to enable the cache:

	service.enable_cache
	service.cache.servers = "localhost:11211"
	service.cache_expiry = 10
